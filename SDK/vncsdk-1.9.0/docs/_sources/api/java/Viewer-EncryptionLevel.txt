.. java:type:: public enum EncryptionLevel
   :outertype: Viewer

   Enumeration of encryption levels.

Enum Constants
--------------

.. java:field:: public static final Viewer.EncryptionLevel DEFAULT
   :outertype: Viewer.EncryptionLevel

   Use strong encryption. This is the default.

.. java:field:: public static final Viewer.EncryptionLevel MAXIMUM
   :outertype: Viewer.EncryptionLevel

   Use the strongest available encryption, possibly at the cost of speed.

.. java:field:: public static final Viewer.EncryptionLevel SERVER
   :outertype: Viewer.EncryptionLevel

   Respect the server's choice of encryption level. This means the viewer will allow connections to third-party servers, but also represents the weakest security, and may open the user up to man-in-the-middle type attacks. Use with caution. Note: to enable this feature, you will need a Third Party Connectivity Add-on code - contact RealVNC for more information.
