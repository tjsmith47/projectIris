Fields
~~~~~~

.. attribute::  Viewer.EncryptionLevel.Default

    Use strong encryption.This is the default.

    

.. attribute::  Viewer.EncryptionLevel.Maximum

    Use the strongest available encryption, possibly at the cost of speed.

    

.. attribute::  Viewer.EncryptionLevel.Server

    Respect the server's choice of encryption level. This means the viewer
    will allow connections to third-party servers, but also represents the
    weakest security, and may open the user up to man-in-the-middle type
    attacks. Use with caution.
    Note: to enable this feature, you will need a Third Party Connectivity
    Add-on code - contact RealVNC for more information.
