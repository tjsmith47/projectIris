Viewer.EncryptionLevel
======================

.. py:class:: vncsdk.Viewer.EncryptionLevel

    Enumeration of encryption levels.

Enumeration Attributes
----------------------

.. py:attribute:: vncsdk.Viewer.EncryptionLevel.DEFAULT

    Use strong encryption.  This is the default.

.. py:attribute:: vncsdk.Viewer.EncryptionLevel.MAXIMUM

    Use the strongest available encryption, possibly at the cost of speed.

.. py:attribute:: vncsdk.Viewer.EncryptionLevel.SERVER

    Respect the server's choice of encryption level. This means the viewer
    will allow connections to third-party servers, but also represents the
    weakest security, and may open the user up to man-in-the-middle type
    attacks. Use with caution.
    Note: to enable this feature, you will need a Third Party Connectivity
    Add-on code - contact RealVNC for more information.
